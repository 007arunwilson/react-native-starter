Hi! I'm started this app by '*react-native-cli*',  But you can use '*react-native-create-app*' tool which is more easy to get start.
But personally I recommend '*react-native-cli*' because it gives you more flexibility and freedom to your development environment and I think it will give some what Idea how the things work in background.
